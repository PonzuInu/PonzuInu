PONZU INU is an original character integrating Egyptian motifs, pop culture tropes such as pyramids being constructed by aliens, and crypto idioms such as blasting off into space, as a satirical comment on the Inu mania and "multilevel marketing" involved in the economics of memecoin marketing.

PONZU INU is a decentralized gameified tokenomics experiment. Designed to positively incentivize buyer psychology through competition and bonuses for smart trading and planned friction on selling mechanics, PONZU is a new form of token. PONZU has ambitions to reach the expanse of space to Pluto, locking liquidity for the long-haul voyage. 

The PONZU INU team's ambition and plan is to become one of the best branded meme coins within the Defi space.
